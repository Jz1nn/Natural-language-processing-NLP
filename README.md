## **Repository Contents**

### **1. VADER Sentiment Analysis**
- Implementation of the **VADER** model for sentiment analysis.
- Focused on text classification tasks with rules.

### **2. Classical NLP Techniques**
- Preprocessing with `NLTK` and `spaCy`:
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization
- Named Entity Extraction (NER)

### **3. Topic Modeling**
- Techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- Identifying topics in large datasets.

### **4. Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis**
- Using **LSTMs** to classify sentiments in text.

### **5. Transformers and Pre-Trained Models**
- Practical applications with **BERT** and **GPT**:
- Sentiment analysis
- Question answering
- Text generation
